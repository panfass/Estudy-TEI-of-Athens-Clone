The project is hosted temporarily on my VPS server under Glassfish local Server thus the weird redirection!

## Aim

This project was developed mostly under a course of my bachelor's curriculum and I later improved it.
It is a **full role-based system** meaning that it gives you different permissions and acts depending on the user who logged in.
The similarity with the Estudy clone was random and just for fun! If you don't know Estudy it is just a common GradeBook that Greek Universities tend to use. It was developed a while ago and I think that we all agree that it's not the most ideal platform!
